# ThreePhysics
Repository that contains practical work learning for my physics simulation course class at the IMAC

### Quick start

```bash
# install the dependencies via npm
npm install

# start the server in dev mode with HMR
npm run start
```
### npm scripts

* `npm run start` - runs the compiler and a server at the same time in dev mode with HMR (Hot Module Replacement) ðŸ”¥.
* `npm run build` - runs the compiler once and generates a production build.
